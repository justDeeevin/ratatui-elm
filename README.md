# ratatui-elm

A simple Elm architecture framework for ratatui.

The architecture is heavily inspired by [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced). It provides an ergonomic interface for executing long-running tasks in the background and handling events concurrently, while only rerendering when strictly necessary.

See [the hello world example](https://github.com/justdeeevin/ratatui-elm/blob/main/examples/hello-world.rs) for a basic usage example.
